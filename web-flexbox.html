            <h4> <i>
                    There are several reasons why I would absolutly love to visit Paris. Fist and foremost, Paris is a very
                    romantic city.
                    Many people know Paris as the City
                    of Love. Paris is so romantic because of many reasons. The city is very charming. There are lots of cute
                    streets and
                    cafes. And
                    there are great sights to see with your partner.One of the most romantic things in Paris is the Eiffel
                    Tower. You can
                    see the Eiffel Tower from several parts of the city. One of the best views of the Eiffel Tower is at
                    Trocadéro. The Iron
                    Lady looks wonderful from there. Seeing the Eiffel Tower is always romantic. But seeing a sunrise there
                    is even better!
                    So if you like waking up early,
                    I’d definitely recommend seeing sunrise at the Eiffel Tower..<br></br>
    
                    Secondly, Paris has some breathtaking viewpoints. Seeing one of the views is amazing which is another
                    one of the reasons
                    to visit
                    Paris. One of the most famous places to get a view is at the Eiffel Tower which I have attached the
                    picture of ^__^.
                    Getting to the top of the Eiffel Tower looks like it would be
                    something worth exploring. From there, you have a wonderful view of the city. Nonetheless, But there are
                    more amazing
                    viewpoints which are also why I want to visit Paris! For example, you can also climb the
                    Sacré-Cœur. Few people know that, but it looks Like it would be an amazing experience. When you climb
                    the Sacré-Cœur,
                    you have an incredible
                    view of the city. Ive read It's even better than the view from the Eiffel Tower. One of the reasons why
                    I would love
                    this view so much
                    is that you can also see the Eiffel Tower from there. Furthermore, you can get a view from the Arc de
                    Triomphe as well.
                    I'd recommend seeing this view at night. Then, you can
                    see the lights of the city. It looks wonderful!<br></br>
                    Paris is also famous for its lovely cafes. Going to one of the cafes would be a great experience! This
                    is also why you
                    should visit Paris. You can sit at a Parisian cafe for hours. Watch people going by, have some coffee,
                    and enjoy your
                    time in the City of Love!.Another reason why I want to visit Paris is that there are baguettes and
                    croissants!
                    Baguettes and croissants are very typical for France. And I have read that they are so delicious!
    
                    There are many bakeries in the city where you can find them. But you can also buy them at grocery
                    stores.

            I would love to learn the languages in the table below because I believe that the more you use your brain to
            learn new skills, the more your brain's functions work. Learning a new language pushes your brain to get
            familiar with new grammar and vocabulary rules. It allows you to train your memory to remember new words,
            make connections between them, and use them in contextual situations.
