                <h4> <i>
                        There are several reasons why I would absolutly love to visit Paris. Fist and foremost, Paris is a
                        very
                        romantic city.
                        Many people know Paris as the City
                        of Love. Paris is so romantic because of many reasons. The city is very charming. There are lots of
                        cute
                        streets and
                        cafes. And
                        there are great sights to see with your partner.One of the most romantic things in Paris is the
                        Eiffel
                        Tower. You can
                        see the Eiffel Tower from several parts of the city. One of the best views of the Eiffel Tower is at
                        Trocadéro. The Iron
                        Lady looks wonderful from there. Seeing the Eiffel Tower is always romantic. But seeing a sunrise
                        there
                        is even better!
                        So if you like waking up early,
                        I’d definitely recommend seeing sunrise at the Eiffel Tower..

            I would love to learn the languages in the table below because I believe that the more you use your brain to
            learn new skills, the more your brain's functions work. Learning a new language pushes your brain to get
            familiar with new grammar and vocabulary rules. It allows you to train your memory to remember new words,
            make connections between them, and use them in contextual situations.
